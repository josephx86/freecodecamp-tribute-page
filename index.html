        <ul>
          <li>She was born during a storm on Mount Targon.</li>
          <li>Her mother passed away soon after Diana was born.</li>
          <li>The name 'Diana' was given by hunters from a Solari Temple who found her the day after she was born.</li>
          <li>As one of the Solari, Diana was raised to venerate the sun in all its aspects.</li>
          <li>She learned the legends of the sun and was trained by the Ra-Horak, the warrior templars of the Solari.</li>
          <li>Contrary to what the Solari elders taught, Diana grew interested in moonlight.</li>
          <li>Diana found moonlight entrancing and beautiful in a way the harsh sun glaring down the mountain could never match.</li>
          <li>As the years went by, Diana found hereself ever at odds with the Solari elders and their teachings.</li>
          <li>She couldn't help but question al she was told, always suspecting there was more that went unsaid in every teaching, as though what she was being taught was willfully incomplete.</li>
          <li>As she grew, Diana's sense of isolation only became stronger as childhood friends distanced themselves from here.</li>
          <li>With every passing day, Diana felt more alone and more certain that some vital aspect of her life remained unfulfilled.</li>
          <li>While sweeping the temple library as punishment for arguing with one of her elders, Diana discovered the partially burned pages of an ancient manuscript.</li>
          <li>From the fragmentary text, Diana learned of an all-but-extinct group known as the Lunari, wose faith saw the moon as a source of life and balance.</li>
        </ul>
